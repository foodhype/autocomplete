autocomplete
============

Python implementation of auto-complete using edit-distance for matching. This is still experimental and may not necessarily require using a trie. Edit distance is a sexy way to find matches, although it takes a few seconds, so I may eventually replace it with a BK tree solution that utilizes edit distance but runs faster.
