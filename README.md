autocomplete
============

Python implementation of auto-complete using suggest tree and BK tree. (My suggest tree includes additional indexing for better space efficiency.)

Possible future enhancements: (1) re-weighting completions after some form of user selection; (2) completion based on sentence context or phonetics might be interesting.
